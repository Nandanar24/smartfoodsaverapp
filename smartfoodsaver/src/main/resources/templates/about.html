  <h1>About SmartFoodSaver</h1>
  <p>
    SmartFoodSaver was created with one mission in mind: to help households save money and reduce food waste.
    By making it easier to track expiry dates, plan meals, and learn storage tips, families can take control of
    their kitchens while doing good for the environment.

      <li>Food waste costs households money and increases landfill emissions.</li>
      <li>Small changes — better storage, smarter shopping, planned leftovers — add up.</li>
      <li>Our tools make it simple: reminders, ideas, and clear storage guidance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Database usage</h2>
    <p>
      SmartFoodSaver uses an <strong>H2 database</strong> for lightweight, in-memory or file-based storage — perfect for
      testing, development, and small-scale production environments.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>User registration details (name, email, encrypted password) are securely stored.</li>
      <li>Meal planner data, expiry reminders, and storage tips are linked to your account for a personalized experience.</li>
      <li>Passwords are encrypted using <strong>BCrypt</strong> for enhanced security.</li>
      <li>For future updates, the system can easily migrate to MySQL or PostgreSQL for long-term data persistence.</li>
    </ul>
